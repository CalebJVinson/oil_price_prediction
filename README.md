For this project, I was working from my coursework series in mathematical computing. When considering the model, I wanted to use neural networks.

# Choice of Nueral Network

There are three broad neural network classes: *Feedforward*, *convolutional*, and *recurrent*.

We will use a recurrent network. However, we will justify this decision by defining the model and use cases of each model type.

## Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
